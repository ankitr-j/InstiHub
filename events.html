                        is currently popular all over the world.

                        backgrounds, Shaastra has always been a very beneficial learning experience.
                        <br>Intense competitions, lectures, and a variety of educational courses provided by Shaastra
                        provide a stage for participants to demonstrate their knowledge and enthusiasm. Watch out for

                        successful citizens, we inspire. It is this inspiration that one gets in these lectures.
    
                        One cannot achieve big without listening to people who have done it before. It is as they say; we
                        shall not live long enough to learn from our own mistakes. We shall have to learn from others’ too.
    
                        <br>The Extra Mural Lectures in IITM, cover diverse topics, and bring in people from across the
                        globe; those people, who have been pioneers and who have received the highest honours in their
                        fields.
    
                        Where else do you get to interact with people so knowledgeable, so experienced and so successful?
    
                        The faces that you see on a television screen are brought before you to talk. These lectures unfold
                        tales of unfathomable perseverance and unmatched genius.

                        tech-related events for points, power and glory.
    
                        Together with Schroeter and Lit Soc, it forms the three independent “Big” trophies that hostels

                        also be organized so that

                        brilliant performance from the students.
